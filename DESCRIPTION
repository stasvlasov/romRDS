Description: The ~romRDS~ package provides a wrapper that handles
    assignment of the code's resulting value to an object. The wrapper
    automatically saves the value in .rds and for later invocations can
    use this file to skip evaluation. Basically the wrapper either Reads
    from the disk Or Makes RDS files for later reuse (hence ~romRDS~
    name). The main motivation is to avoid unnecessary reevaluation of
    some computationally expensive code chunks (e.g., when your R session
    crashed and you lost all the objects) and free up from frequent
    snapshots of the entire environment to the .Rdata.
